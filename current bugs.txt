Fixed bugs:

-[1h] Diagonal Pixel size calibration: No longer uses either the x or y coordinate to calibrate length and now correctly calculates the length of the diagonal selected.
-[4h] Zoom and pan are now preserved through panel changes, including in SpatialAnalysis when switching between original, enhanced, and masked image. Same with tools when applicable.
-[1h]Enhance Colors: predefined enhancements didn't work after selecting the first one. This was one of the original bugs and has been fixed with the merging of versions
-[0.5h]Mask: Image no longer masks on zoom as requested.
-[1h]In Old Growth Forest, tool can now be manipulated from every image.
-[3h]Open recent didn't work: it now does, be sure to check a panel to see the newly opened picture. An important number of bugs related to image format were also fixed.
-[1h]Predefined enhancements now work on the original image, not on the displayed version unless the "use image as original" button is clicked; note that pressing that button resets zoom.
-[2h]Enhance Colors had a lot of zoom related bugs and problems that significantly hindered performance but more importantly slightly misadjusted zoom and pan values making precision nearly impossible. Things are rock steady now.
-[3h]In Time Series window, the tool drawn remains when changing enhancement and values are recalculated automatically. This was a tricky one!
-[4h]In Spatial analysis, the display for masked pixels was not implemented at all and setup to simply display the total number of pixels. I found a nifty little trick to get an accurate number of masked pixels for each of the tools. This is what caused the bug with the Polygon tool reported by Francis Precht

<TO-DO>

---In DigitalImageBasics, in the tabs "Colors", "Data in Images", 
	and "False Color", in the "Select an Image" drop down menu, 
	the option "Your Picture" does not work. 
	Does not open a Picture from Open dialog box.


I found some more problems with DIB. In the original version, File
lets you save the image, prints it, open an image, etc. The java
version just offers save. Using your own photo is a nice option.
