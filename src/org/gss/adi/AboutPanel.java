Funding by National Science Foundation of University of Massachusetts, Amhest's \"STEM Digital\" project, led by Mort Sternheim.\r\n\r\nThe original software components were created by John Pickle and Jacqueline Kirtley, Museum of Science, Boston, MA in support of the Lawrence Hall of Science's Global Systems Science student series in 2002 with NASA funding.\r\n\r\nThese revisions were created to support the NASA-funded project, Digital Earth Watch, http://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/gss/dew/index.html.  This educational project was a collaboration between seven institutions (logos have rollover urls) to develop learning activities, technologies, and software to measure environmental health by monitoring plants:\r\n\r\n   - Museum of Science, Boston, MA (lead institution) \r\n\r\n   - Global Systems Science, Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, CA (co-lead) \r\n\r\n   - Forest Watch, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH (co-lead)\r\n\r\n   - EOS-Webster, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH \r\n\r\n   - Remote Sensing and GIS Laboratory, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN\r\n\r\n   - Blue Hill Observatory, Milton, MA â€“ \r\n\r\n   - College of Education and Human Development, University of Southern Maine, \r\n      Portland, ME\r\n\r\nJohn Pickle programmed these revisions, which reflect invaluable feedback and input from the DEW team and years of working with teachers and informal science educators.
